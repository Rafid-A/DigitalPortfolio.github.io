      <h4>Ai Sentience</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">There is a new topic on the block within the Tech fields, which is about Sentient AI. People are talking about whether or not Sentient AI is good for humans or bad for humans. Sentient AI is very beneficial for humans, but as long as they stay within their protocols of being sentient which could be very difficult to achieve. If they can override that protocol that can put their behavior way off the line then the situation could drastically change for the worse.<br><br>
      <h4>Sentient AI can be beneficial</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">Sentient AI can be very beneficial for humans in many different ways. In today's
	    world one of the closest to sentient AI we have is self-driving cars. They can drive through the roads by themselves feeding in input from its sensors which comes from other vehicles' movements. They know when to brake and when to change lanes and it all comes to responding defensively to
	    other drivers maneuvers which is a function that is associated with consciousness.(Musser, 2017) This could make driving a whole lot safer by taking out human errors. Sentient AI can also help humans in other normal livelihood tasks which can change from day to day and the AI can adapt to them and do the
	    tasks which would reduce the workload on humans in general. The AI can also take on the jobs that require workers to put their life on the line, or are trying to save a life. The AI can have almost bulletproof reliability on completing those tasks successfully allowing more humans to live.
	    Sentient AI also allows for a future for human society where they can make a lot of leaps in advancements really quickly to ensure the sustainability of human survival . For example, exploring outer space to the point where humans can really open up a lot of new doors for mankind in the
	    future without risking more human lives for it. These are some of the very core benefits that Sentient AI can have for us.</p><br><br>
      <h4>Possible consequences of Sentient AI</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">While Sentient AI is beneficial to humans, it can lead to some repercussions which can lead to the downfall of human society. If AI becomes sentient
	    they will take up majority of the hard working labor forces. In those areas communication is important and now matter how “Sentient” the AI is their thinking will always be different than humans which leads to miscommunication, which can lead to the production chain to breakdown. A big
	    consequence of Sentient AI is that we may not be able to control the AI.(Gordon, 2022) AI could in theory become more sentient than humans & most definitely could become more intelligent than humans. This can lead to situations where we lost control over them. They can do things we can't predict anymore
	    and do other things that will surprise us. We could end up in a situation where the AI ends up controlling all aspects of human existence, including all physical laws themselves through sheer force of numbers.(Gordon, 2022) Another possible negative effect of sentient AI could be that it can lead more
	    distrust in the human society as those who can own or control such AI would receive benefits while everyone that cannot own or control AI would suffer without the access. This will most like create a massive divide of believes and livelihood in the human society than there already is.</p>
	    <br><br>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">We are on the edge of a massive breakthrough in AI. In the recent years Machine learning has been becoming a very important part of the Tech industry. We're not close at all to making a sentient AI, but its not unthinkable that we will be able to soon. In order to make
	    sure everything goes right when making the AI we need to have an system where we can properly relate & communicate with them so we don’t suffer major consequences.</p>
