      <h4>Decision Biases</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">We make numerous decisions that have a significant impact on our own lives. Each of these decisions contains a factor that contributes to the decision. And one major factor is our biases, which influence us to choose one option over another. There are numerous biases that lead to our individual decision-making, which varies from person to person. Still, there are some standard decision-making thought processes shared between people that lead to their own but similar decision bias toward something.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Survivorship Bias</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">This bias leads to people becoming overly optimistic because we only look at those who prospered, meaning that if I copy what they are doing, I will also achieve the same level of success. This may impact me because I used to have a similar mindset and still do sometimes. I am actively moving away from it as this can lead me to copy other people without really learning anything or getting the wrong idea of what will make me successful in this project. I intend to overcome this by thoroughly researching everything, looking at its pros and cons, and then deciding how incorporating that into our project will make us successful.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Confirmation Bias</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">This bias is the action people take to make themselves feel good, so they only listen to or respect the data that aligns with their viewpoints. This leads to them rejecting any opposing beliefs. This can impact my team and me because we each have a strong opinion on what is best for our project, and we will try to incorporate that into the project. This can lead to confusion and misunderstanding, and miscommunication between us. We intend to overcome this by challenging our viewpoints and taking in information from various sources with different perspectives.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Anchoring Bias</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">This bias is also known as "first impression bias" and relates to the tendency to leap to conclusions based solely on what we learned early on and form a single opinion on it while not considering other options. When researching a topic or technology, the first impressions of it can be excellent until we start using it. "Another example of the Anchoring and Adjustment bias is the first impression syndrome, where people fail to correct or adjust their opinion of someone after an instant assessment at their first encounter".(Arnott, 4) To overcome this, we must slow down and take more time to look into the technologies we use and also take time to learn about everyone who we work with to understand them the best and not rush any decision-making.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Overconfidence Bias</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">This goes hand in hand with the previous bias when someone feels overly confident in their ability to execute something just by having an excellent first impression. With limited knowledge and experience, an idealistic faith in my decision can lead me to act on hunches. Another way too look at this is that "People who want to win a lottery, get a particular job, or have their football team win, can easily overestimate success even when they already have, or have access to information that should abate their desire.".(Arnott, 10) and this also applied to Computer Science. This can lead to trying unnecessarily to implement something arduous and unnecessary and take up a lot of your time that could be used to make your product better. I plan to overcome this by Asking myself questions such as: What information did I use to form my decision? Was this based on facts or feelings? Will this improve my project and help me? Etc.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Progress Bias</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">This bias is when we give too much credit to our work, even though the not-so-good can offset it. Sometimes we overemphasize the consequences of our constructive actions while at the same time undermining the results of our harmful actions. Such as using methods of practising code that can lead to confusion with teams and using relatively unoptimized and somewhat unreadable code that can slow down our workflow. We plan on overcoming this by carefully looking at the work we are doing and ensuring everyone is on the same page so the project can be completed as smoothly as possible while also making sure everybody contributes meaningfully.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">It is usual for people to have biases. That is how we function as human beings, but some biases can negatively affect our life. It is best to look at those things objectively and form an opinion based on facts and hard evidence rather than feelings or first impressions without having any background knowledge. These biases can be avoided or toned down simply by diversifying one's research about a topic.</p>
