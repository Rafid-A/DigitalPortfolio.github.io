      <h4>Decision Biases</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">We make numerous decisions that have a significant impact on our own lives. Each of these decisions contains a factor that contributes to the decision. And one major factor is our biases, which influence us to choose one option over another. There are numerous biases that lead to our own unique decision-making, which varies from person to person. Still, there are some standard decision-making thought processes shared between people that lead to their own but similar decision bias toward something.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Survivorship Bias</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">This bias leads to people becoming overly optimistic because we only look at those who prospered, meaning that if I copy what they are doing I will also achieve the same level of success. This may impact me because I used to have a mindset similar to this and still do in some cases And am actively moving away from it as this can lead me to copy other people     without really learning anything or getting an inaccurate idea of what will make me successful in this project. I intend to overcome this by thoroughly researching everything and looking at the pros and cons of it, and then deciding how incorporating that into our project will make us successful.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Confirmation Bias</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">This bias is the action people make in order to make themselves feel good, so they only listen to or respect the data that aligns with their viewpoints. This leads to them rejecting any opposing beliefs. This can impact me and my team because we all each have a strong opinion on what we believe is best for our project and will try to incorporate that into the project. This can lead to confusion and misunderstanding and miscommunication between us. We intend to overcome this by challenging our own viewpoints, along with taking in information from various sources that have different perspectives.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Anchoring Bias</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">This bias is also known as “first impression bias”, and relates to the tendency to leap to conclusions based solely on what we learned early on and form a single opinion on it, while also not considering other options. When researching a topic or technology the first impressions of it can be really good until we actually start using it. This has happened to me many times and might happen again in this project as I'm planning on using other new technologies. To overcome this we have to slow down and use more of our time to look into technologies that we use and not rush any decision-making.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Overconfidence Bias</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">This goes hand in hand with the previous bias as when someone feels overly confident in their ability to execute something just by having a good first impression about it.  With limited knowledge and experience, an idealistic faith in my own decision can lead me to act on hunches. This can lead to trying unnecessarily to implement something that is very hard and just not necessary. I plan to overcome this by Asking myself questions such as: What information did I use to form my decision? Was this based on facts or feelings? etc.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Progress Bias</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">This bias is when we give too much credit to the work we have done, despite the fact that they can be offset by the not-so-good. Sometimes we overemphasize the consequences of our constructive actions, while at the same time undermining the consequences of our harmful actions. Such as using methods of practicing code that can lead to confusion with teams and using relatively unoptimized and rather unreadable code that can slow down our workflow so. We plan on overcoming this by carefully looking at the work we are doing and making sure everyone is on the same page so the project can be completed as smoothly as possible while also making sure everybody contributes meaningfully.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4><br>
      <p class="Paragraph">It is normal for people to have biases. That is how we function as human beings, but some biases can be a negative addition to our life. It is best to look at those things objectively and form an opinion based on facts and hard evidence rather than feelings or first impressions without having any background knowledge. All of these biases can be avoided or toned down simply by diversifying one's research about a topic.</p>
