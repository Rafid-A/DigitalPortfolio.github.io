        <h1>Considered ISP Proposals</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h3>1.Project Bolt<a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/matthew-roman/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">(Link)</a></h3>
	<br>
        <p>The reason I considered this is because I like the concept of making an application that makes it easier for computer science teacher to communicate with students.
	  There is lots of technologies involved in computer science and they can have problems and it look like to me that this app can solve some of that problem. Also this
	  including helpful information about computer science to help students is also a very good things to have when you cant get hold of a teacher you can just the website
	  as is to learn from it.However the reason I did not choose this is because for me I think this is personally a bit too plain and also I do not agree on having a price
	  tag on this necessarily and also I think other projects I have looked in to are just much better.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>2.Foob<a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/sophie-hews/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">(Link)</a></h3>
	<br>
	<p>I considered this project because having an applicaton for telling you what food you can make based on the ingredients you have laying around house at any given time
	  is very cool and can be huge quality of life improvement. I also think this is a very unique idea and can be used to a greater extent in the future. However the reason
	  I ultimately ended up not choosing this is because I have seen other project ideas that are more cool and ambitious from my point of view which I would put in higher in my
	  list and also this project I think could use more features that just the core features of being able to make a food, features could be related to health and how diet of person
	  varies etc.</p>

        <h3>3.Castaway<a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/shivangi-gupta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">(Link)</a></h3>
	<br>
        <p>I considered this as on of the projects I would work with is primarility because this kind of falls in the line of what I am going to do myself. Other reasons as to why
	  I chose this would also be the fact this makes my and other people lives easier to plan and go to places, even though there are compitetion there is no doubt this project has
	  high potential although this project is unique in itself with the ideas proposed to it but there are some strong competitions. However I ended up not choosing this primarily
	  because there is better project ideas that I am more interested in and I think this idea from the surface level is not as challenging as I would like it to be.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>4.Social Media Bot<a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aidan-valva/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">(Link)</a></h3>
	<br>
        <p>This is one of the projects I actually considered a lot because I actually wanted to origianlly work with AI and make a bot for a project. This is very similar to that
	  and I like the way it utilizes the bot in the social media space and how it will improved businesses being able to capitalize oppurnities that will present themselves by using
	  this bot and giving targeted ads to people that the people will actually like and businesses will get their sales in. The way I see it this can be a win win situation. However I ended
	  up not choosing this because I ended up changing my mind about working with a bot and would rather do something else and also this project does not necessarily match the ways I wanted
	  to use a bot nonetheless this is a great approach to using a bot like this.</p>

        <h3>5.Organizer App<a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brook-asnake/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">(Link)</a></h3>
	<br>
        <p>This one is one of the ones at the top my list of actually working with. I really like this planner/calendar idea and how it differentiates itself from other similar applications
	  with its functionality and looks. The features it offers also could be good quality of life improves and overall I really dig this idea of a planner/calendar as it is similar to my idea.
	  However I ended up not choosing this because I think my personal idea is better than this and some other projects are more unique and interesting to consider working with but this is what I
	  would choose as my project If I ended up not choosing my own so this is very very close runner-up.</p>

        <h3>6.On Track<a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/james-dungan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">(Link)</a></h3>
	<br>
        <p>I think this is very unique trip planner in its self, I really like how it will plan out the cheapest route for you to national parks and bring people back to visit national parks by making
	  it easier for them. I also really like the way it will plan the route and include other stuff that can be very fun to see while also minimalizing cost as much as possible and from the looks of it
	  it will be as accurate as google maps so its just a better gps system designed to visit national park which I think is very cool. However I ended up not choosing this because of me wanting do something
	 different and also there being other projects which I consider to be more tempting to choose from.</p>
