	manage the team and effectively communicate with them over the internet due to the easy to use nature of the product.
	This will be done through making the UI more simpler and minimalistic as possible while not losing functionality and
	be visually appealing compared to our competitors who might throw in a user with a very complex UI system.</p>

	 such as Jira, Monday.com, Clickup to name a few.</p>
