      <h1>Sorting Analysis</h1>
      <p>Summary: There was a lot of tests done (270 to be exact) for these 3 different sort aglorithms. The main picture is that Bubble Sort is the slowest out  of all these sort types. InsertionSort and SelectionSort go back and forth with eatch
	other depending on the file type that is being tested on them. The way the sort was done was using multiple word counts for each types of file such as 10 or 100 words for either ordered, random, or reverse ordered file. The first 3 graphs that
	are in the Spreadsheet summary page gives a visualization on the time differences between each sort based on the type of file that was being used. The last graph is there to give another way of visualizing the time different between the
	different sorting algorithms all together. Due to bubblesort timing out on every 100k word file that was being tested, I tested it as close to that 100k limit as I can without it timing out and then putting a educated guess on what the time
	should be for a 100k word file for each file type. I have optimized these sort alogrithms as much as I can so in my opinion this is a very fair test to compare each of the algorithms against each other. Here is the Link to the Spreadsheet
	below:
