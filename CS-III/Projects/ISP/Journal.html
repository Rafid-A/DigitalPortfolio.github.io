        <p>(Software) Development Engineer - The Development Engineer is responsible for analyzing users' needs and designing and creating an application to meet those needs. Recommend software upgrades for customers' existing programs and systems. Design each piece of an application or system and plan how the pieces will work together. They also help build software systems that power networks and devices and ensure that those systems remain functional. Working with the QA Engineers they also write up tests for their own software as a preliminary check to make sure it is functional. Although not my preferred role, I am very decently comfortable with this role as I have good experience and am confident in my ability to program a product from scratch. The challenges that can be encountered with this role is mainly programming challenges and I will try to overcome them by doing more reasearch and getting an better understanding of the code I need to write.</p><br>
        <p>QA Engineer - The QA Engineer oversees the testing and quality management of software prior to the release of the product or application. To find and identify bugs and possible problems with new software, they plan and perform testing at different stages of the development process. They think of every possible problem a user can encounter and rewrite to program so it fits the user's needs better. They also communicate with the Development Engineer in order to suggest improvements that can be made to the application. They also contribute to the tests that are created for testing the application with the Development engineer. This is my preferred role as I really like digging and debugging others code as it teaches me to understand code and also understand others which makes working in a team environment much easier and I think I am the perfect for this role since I am also pretty good at it.The challenges that can be encountered with this role not understanding others peoples code which I can overcome by communicating well with my teammates and understand their point of view on the code.</p><br>
        <p>Project Manager - A Project Manager is responsible for the planning, procurement, execution and completion of a project. The project manager is in charge of the entire project and handles everything involved, such as the project scope, managing the project team, as well as the resources assigned to the project. They communicate with the development team to coordinate the timeline that best fits the deadline of the project and create a unique routine that the developers can follow. I don't think I will suit any managing role as I don't have much or any experience at all in managing a team. The main challenge of this role would be being able to communication with the team on a timely and understandable manner which can be overcome by setting up an timeline for our work.<p><br>
        <p>Product Manager - They are the ones that come up with the idea of a project. A product manager is the person who identifies the customer need and the larger business objectives that a product or feature will fulfil articulates what success looks like for a product and rallies a team to turn that vision into a reality. They communicate with the development team on the specifics of the product so the development team can develop the product with the best possible understanding of it. I also think this is another role that does not suit me as much because of the lack of experience as well as the creativeness needed for this role. The challenge for this would also be communicating well with teammates but also having the right vision for what the end product needs to be and this challenge can be overcome by researching each individual component of the product and making a educated decision on what is the best for it.</p><br>
        <p>Release Engineer - The Release engineers work with software engineers in product development to define all the steps required to release software such as from how the software is stored in the source code repository, to build rules for compilation, to how testing, packaging, and deployment are conducted. They also manage the source control application making sure that everything is in an organized fashion while also making sure the product is released at the right time with no setbacks. I think this role suits me as I am decently experienced with working and managing source control and dealing with conflicts within the source control by team members. The challenge for this role would be just dealing with a lot of conflicts in source control which can be overcome by also having the experience with dealing with them and also researching about possible conflicts ahead of time and know the solution.
