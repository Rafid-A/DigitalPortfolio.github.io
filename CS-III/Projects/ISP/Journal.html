      <h2>27-Mar-2023</h2>
      <p>Technical Challenges - I faced some techincal challenges with tabby and emacs as it was really refusing to work properly and I honestly have no idea why, so I just ended up brute forcing through the issue and work on whatever I can trying to just ignore the issue, and eventually it was fixed.</p><br>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges - We didnt have much scheduling challenges this week as each of us were busy with our merlin missions which took pretty much the entire week which resulted us in not having much time to work on ISP.</p><br>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges - We did not have any interpersonal challenges this week as we did not get to work on our ISP, however we are all on the same page as to what needs to be done for our ISP in the upcoming weeks.</p><br>

      <h2>20-Mar-2023</h2>
      <p>Technical Challenges - I faced more techincal challenges with react router dom and the set up of it as it broke all the html and css in the pages we had so I had to redo it and fix most of it. Also it took a few tries for me get react router dom to properly render the right components in the first place, these were not that bad to overcome however they were quite tedious to work with.</p><br>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges - We didnt have much scheduling challenges aside form the factor that everyone is starting to get more quiz and tests added to their schedule so it is becoming harded to find a day to meet up and talk but we still communicate through github and discord messaging.</p><br>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges - We did not have any interpersonal challenges this week ,infact I would consider this one of our best weeks to date as everyone was really on top of what they could do with the little time they had, although I would still argue that we are a little behind.</p><br>

      <h2>13-Mar-2023</h2>
      <p>Technical Challenges - I faced techincal challenges about the landing page formatting as the way I have set up the landing page formatting is with the use of multiple js file being rendered in one page in a certain order and I faced some challenges in fixing some ui elements and positioning to make it look better. I also faced some techincal challenges about react router dom as I am preparing to set it up with our project.</p><br>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges - We did not face any scheduling challenges this week as I have already talked with my team about the plan for this week and we are up to date with our current plan. We are trying to plan a bit ahead to minimize the schedule conflict.</p><br>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges - we didnt have any interpersonal challenges as everyone is communicating well and working on the part they have been assigned to for the most part, however since some things are still new to us some team member are just a tad behind.</p><br>

      <h2>20-Feb-2023</h2>
      <p>Technical Challenges - The technical challenges I had this week was mainly making the Landing page, I had a lot of bugs while making the page but they were minor for the most part. The navigation, about portion of the page were quite hard to make the way I wanted to make them with react as the way it all fits together is quite different. However the CSS needed for the landing page too even look half decent was very tiring to say the least.</p><br>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges - No scheduling challenges this week expect for the fact that we coudnt really find a time to meet up until friday, but in the end it worked for us and we got most if not everything we wanted to work on for this week done.</p><br>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges - We did not have any interpersonal challeges this week as every one communicated their part of work and even in github in my opinion we have very good communication and everyone is roughly on track with the project.</p><br>
      
      <h2>13-Feb-2023</h2>
      <p>Technical Challenges - In terms of technical challenges we had lots of bugs and issue we needed to iron out after us working on our initial MVP product so we spent most of the week just trying to indentify the bugs and have them up as issues within the github, simultaneously we also added some smaller features to our currently exisiting MVP.</p><br>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges - We had some scheduling challenges as each of us had a lot of work for other classes we needed to do however we mostly got them done by thursaday so after school friday we were able to meet up and talk about our ISP. </p><br>
      <p>Interpersonal Challgenes - We didnt have any much of a interpersonal challenge, it was just that one of our team member was a little behind in their work due to them having to focus on otehr work and test for different classes however, since the beginning of the week he has caught up with the rest of the team on the ISP.</p><br>

      <h2>6-Feb-2023</h2>
      <p>Technical Challenges - I had a lot of technical challenges of adding functionality to our project so the user can input the data required for a ticket and have it show up on the current issues page. I am currently in the middle of solving this by working with one of my teammate and also
      researching on the packages that are required to be able to add the functionality in react as it is very different than normal website.</p><br>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges - No scheduling challenges at the moment as we have allocated times to the project and have been able to meet up and catch up with eath other on how we want to progress with our project and we were also able to divide up the sections we need to work on.</p><br>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges - We did not have any interpersonal challenges as everyone is communicating well and is on track. However our workflow did drop a significant amount since the ice storm so we are collectively working on that together to bring it back up.</p><br>

      <h2>30-Jan-2023</h2>
      <p>Technical Challenges - I had some technical challenges of setting up react properly so I can get start on our product. I had do some research to know what parts of file do we need from the react folder it creates automatically. I managed to solve this by deleting unnecesary files and making sure my .gitignore had correct folders in them so the github repository could be clean.</p><br>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges - We had some scheduling challenges as there was an ice storm this week which threw off everyones schedule so we all just decided to work on our own time. However when we got the change we had group call to talk about the project and planning of it.</p><br>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges - We did not have any interpersonal challenges this week either as we are still working on things from last week due to the ice storm; learning their roles and the technologies they are going to work with.</p><br>

      <h2>23-Jan-2023</h2> 
      <p>Technical Challenges - I did not have much tecnical challenges this week but rather all the challenges I had were just learning the new technologies that I need to work and I plan on overcoming this by just using and learning more about the techology.</p><br>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges - Due to each of us being in sperate classes and having sepeare life/workloads finding a time where we all can come together and work on it is difficult. We are actively working on schedules that work for all of us alongside our other classworks.</p><br>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges - We did not have any interpersonal challenges as everyone is just trying to learn the technologies on their own and we all know each other progress and we also communicate well with each other now that it has been a few weeks we have been working on this.</p><br>
      
      <h2>16-Jan-2023</h2>
      <p>Technical Challenges - Some technical challenges I encountered was with dealing with merge issues within Github, oher technicall issues I dealt with was not knowing to work with some of the technologies that we are planning on using. I intend to overcome both of these challenges by gaining more experience with each of the component as I continue to work with them.</p><br>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges - Due to each of us being in sperate classes and having sepeare life/workloads finding a time where we all can come together and work on it is difficult. We intend to solve this problem in the near future as we are communicating with eath other to come up with a plan that would suit all of our timeline to an extent and allow us to work efficiently.</p><br>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges - We did not have much interpersonal challenges this week as we already had planned out what we wanted to for this week and we all just followed up on that plan as we expected to. However we are always continuing to improve our efficiency in terms of working together so we can get more done so this hopfully never becomes a challenge.</p><br>

      <h2>9-Jan-2023</h2>
      <p>Technical Challenges - Some technical challenge I encountered was setting up the GitHub repository, as I forgot how to do it. Later I realized that I did not accept the invitation to collaborate on the repository. Once I accepted the invitation, I solved the problem of setting up the repository. Another technical issue I encountered was Merge conflicts, but I solved it quickly as I have experienced it many times before. Also, figuring out how the project board worked was a little confusing at first; however, with time and experimenting, I'm now comfortable with it.</p><br>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges - Due to us being in separate classes with different timeslots of the day, scheduling a time that is comfortable for everyone is difficult. We solved this conflict by compromising on one timeslot that everyone could work on. Another way we solved it was that we agreed that we would keep everyone up to date with communication, but they could work on their own time and not have to be bound by that one timeslot when we all could work. And if there is a case where we all can work together at one time, we will try our best to work.</p><br>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges - We did not have many interpersonal challenges as we all know each other and are good friends. We did not have any challenges in proper communication from each other. However, one challenge was that we disagreed on what we wanted to use for our project, such as the technologies we wanted to use and how we wanted to use them, which was resolved very quickly as we all wanted to learn new technologies. In the future, I expect more disagreements like this on future decisions.</p><br>
      <h2>2-Jan-2023</h2>

      <p>(Software) Development Engineer - The Development Engineer is responsible for analyzing users' needs and designing and creating an application to meet those needs. Recommend software upgrades for customers' existing programs and systems. Design each piece of an application or system and plan how the pieces will work together. They also help build software systems that power networks and devices and ensure that those systems remain functional. Working with the QA Engineers they also write up tests for their own software as a preliminary check to make sure it is functional. Although not my preferred role, I am very decently comfortable with this role as I have good experience and am confident in my ability to program a product from scratch. The challenges that can be encountered with this role is mainly programming challenges and I will try to overcome them by doing more reasearch and getting an better understanding of the code I need to write.</p><br>
      <p>QA Engineer - The QA Engineer oversees the testing and quality management of software prior to the release of the product or application. To find and identify bugs and possible problems with new software, they plan and perform testing at different stages of the development process. They think of every possible problem a user can encounter and rewrite to program so it fits the user's needs better. They also communicate with the Development Engineer in order to suggest improvements that can be made to the application. They also contribute to the tests that are created for testing the application with the Development engineer. This is my preferred role as I really like digging and debugging others code as it teaches me to understand code and also understand others which makes working in a team environment much easier and I think I am the perfect for this role since I am also pretty good at it.The challenges that can be encountered with this role not understanding others peoples code which I can overcome by communicating well with my teammates and understand their point of view on the code.</p><br>
      <p>Project Manager - A Project Manager is responsible for the planning, procurement, execution and completion of a project. The project manager is in charge of the entire project and handles everything involved, such as the project scope, managing the project team, as well as the resources assigned to the project. They communicate with the development team to coordinate the timeline that best fits the deadline of the project and create a unique routine that the developers can follow. I don't think I will suit any managing role as I don't have much or any experience at all in managing a team. The main challenge of this role would be being able to communication with the team on a timely and understandable manner which can be overcome by setting up an timeline for our work.<p><br>
      <p>Product Manager - They are the ones that come up with the idea of a project. A product manager is the person who identifies the customer need and the larger business objectives that a product or feature will fulfil articulates what success looks like for a product and rallies a team to turn that vision into a reality. They communicate with the development team on the specifics of the product so the development team can develop the product with the best possible understanding of it. I also think this is another role that does not suit me as much because of the lack of experience as well as the creativeness needed for this role. The challenge for this would also be communicating well with teammates but also having the right vision for what the end product needs to be and this challenge can be overcome by researching each individual component of the product and making a educated decision on what is the best for it.</p><br>
      <p>Release Engineer - The Release engineers work with software engineers in product development to define all the steps required to release software such as from how the software is stored in the source code repository, to build rules for compilation, to how testing, packaging, and deployment are conducted. They also manage the source control application making sure that everything is in an organized fashion while also making sure the product is released at the right time with no setbacks. I think this role suits me as I am decently experienced with working and managing source control and dealing with conflicts within the source control by team members. The challenge for this role would be just dealing with a lot of conflicts in source control which can be overcome by also having the experience with dealing with them and also researching about possible conflicts ahead of time and know the solution.
