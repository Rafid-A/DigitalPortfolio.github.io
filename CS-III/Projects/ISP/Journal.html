      <p>Technical Challenges - I did not have much tecnicall challenges this week but rather all the challenges I had were just learning the new technologies that I need to work and I plan on overcoming this by just using and learning more about the techology.</p><br>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges - Due to each of us being in sperate classes and having sepeare life/workloads finding a time where we all can come together and work on it is difficult. We are actively working on schedules that work for all of us alongside our other classworks.</p><br>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges - We did not have any interpersonal challenges as everyone is just trying to learn the technologies on their own and we all know each other progress and we also communicate well with each other now that it has been a few weeks we have been working on this.</p><br>
      
      <h2>16-Jan-2023</h2>
      <p>Technical Challenges - Some technical challenges I encountered was with dealing with merge issues within Github, oher technicall issues I dealt with was not knowing to work with some of the technologies that we are planning on using. I intend to overcome both of these challenges by gaining more experience with each of the component as I continue to work with them.</p><br>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges - Due to each of us being in sperate classes and having sepeare life/workloads finding a time where we all can come together and work on it is difficult. We intend to solve this problem in the near future as we are communicating with eath other to come up with a plan that would suit all of our timeline to an extent and allow us to work efficiently.</p><br>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges - We did not have much interpersonal challenges this week as we already had planned out what we wanted to for this week and we all just followed up on that plan as we expected to. However we are always continuing to improve our efficiency in terms of working together so we can get more done so this hopfully never becomes a challenge.</p><br>

      <h2>9-Jan-2023</h2>
      <p>Technical Challenges - Some technical challenge I encountered was setting up the GitHub repository, as I forgot how to do it. Later I realized that I did not accept the invitation to collaborate on the repository. Once I accepted the invitation, I solved the problem of setting up the repository. Another technical issue I encountered was Merge conflicts, but I solved it quickly as I have experienced it many times before. Also, figuring out how the project board worked was a little confusing at first; however, with time and experimenting, I'm now comfortable with it.</p><br>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges - Due to us being in separate classes with different timeslots of the day, scheduling a time that is comfortable for everyone is difficult. We solved this conflict by compromising on one timeslot that everyone could work on. Another way we solved it was that we agreed that we would keep everyone up to date with communication, but they could work on their own time and not have to be bound by that one timeslot when we all could work. And if there is a case where we all can work together at one time, we will try our best to work.</p><br>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges - We did not have many interpersonal challenges as we all know each other and are good friends. We did not have any challenges in proper communication from each other. However, one challenge was that we disagreed on what we wanted to use for our project, such as the technologies we wanted to use and how we wanted to use them, which was resolved very quickly as we all wanted to learn new technologies. In the future, I expect more disagreements like this on future decisions.</p><br>
      <h2>2-Jan-2023</h2>

      <p>(Software) Development Engineer - The Development Engineer is responsible for analyzing users' needs and designing and creating an application to meet those needs. Recommend software upgrades for customers' existing programs and systems. Design each piece of an application or system and plan how the pieces will work together. They also help build software systems that power networks and devices and ensure that those systems remain functional. Working with the QA Engineers they also write up tests for their own software as a preliminary check to make sure it is functional. Although not my preferred role, I am very decently comfortable with this role as I have good experience and am confident in my ability to program a product from scratch. The challenges that can be encountered with this role is mainly programming challenges and I will try to overcome them by doing more reasearch and getting an better understanding of the code I need to write.</p><br>
      <p>QA Engineer - The QA Engineer oversees the testing and quality management of software prior to the release of the product or application. To find and identify bugs and possible problems with new software, they plan and perform testing at different stages of the development process. They think of every possible problem a user can encounter and rewrite to program so it fits the user's needs better. They also communicate with the Development Engineer in order to suggest improvements that can be made to the application. They also contribute to the tests that are created for testing the application with the Development engineer. This is my preferred role as I really like digging and debugging others code as it teaches me to understand code and also understand others which makes working in a team environment much easier and I think I am the perfect for this role since I am also pretty good at it.The challenges that can be encountered with this role not understanding others peoples code which I can overcome by communicating well with my teammates and understand their point of view on the code.</p><br>
      <p>Project Manager - A Project Manager is responsible for the planning, procurement, execution and completion of a project. The project manager is in charge of the entire project and handles everything involved, such as the project scope, managing the project team, as well as the resources assigned to the project. They communicate with the development team to coordinate the timeline that best fits the deadline of the project and create a unique routine that the developers can follow. I don't think I will suit any managing role as I don't have much or any experience at all in managing a team. The main challenge of this role would be being able to communication with the team on a timely and understandable manner which can be overcome by setting up an timeline for our work.<p><br>
      <p>Product Manager - They are the ones that come up with the idea of a project. A product manager is the person who identifies the customer need and the larger business objectives that a product or feature will fulfil articulates what success looks like for a product and rallies a team to turn that vision into a reality. They communicate with the development team on the specifics of the product so the development team can develop the product with the best possible understanding of it. I also think this is another role that does not suit me as much because of the lack of experience as well as the creativeness needed for this role. The challenge for this would also be communicating well with teammates but also having the right vision for what the end product needs to be and this challenge can be overcome by researching each individual component of the product and making a educated decision on what is the best for it.</p><br>
      <p>Release Engineer - The Release engineers work with software engineers in product development to define all the steps required to release software such as from how the software is stored in the source code repository, to build rules for compilation, to how testing, packaging, and deployment are conducted. They also manage the source control application making sure that everything is in an organized fashion while also making sure the product is released at the right time with no setbacks. I think this role suits me as I am decently experienced with working and managing source control and dealing with conflicts within the source control by team members. The challenge for this role would be just dealing with a lot of conflicts in source control which can be overcome by also having the experience with dealing with them and also researching about possible conflicts ahead of time and know the solution.
