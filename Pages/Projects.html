        <h1>Concept</h1>
        <p>It's a top down 2D space shooter, where the player will upgrade
          their ship by killing enemies and attaching modular parts to it.
          The game world is infinite and its meant to be a Roguelike concept
          with limited amount of lives.If all lives are consumed then the game
          completely reset the progress.
        </p>
        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>Gaming is something I really enjoy, and its a very big part of my life
          so with that in mind, I decided with my group to make a game as our ISP 
          project. This allowed us to test our abilities on something something new
          and be able to grow as a programmer and expand our porfolio of projects.
        </p>
        <h1>Example Codes</h1>
	<img src="../Images/Code%20Example%201.png" alt="Code%20Example%201">
	<p>This example above shows the how the AI/Enemy shootes the player.
          We needed to create a spot where the bullet would shoot from which
          is the Gunspot and also create a gameobject that is a Bullet. There
          is a fire delay between each shots that the enemy takes and when they
          take the shot a new gameobject is instantiated with the prefab and the
          position of where the bullet should come out of.
        </p>
        <img src="../Images/Code%20Example%202.png" alt="Code%20Example%202">
        <p>The purpose of the example above is to visually show that the player
          was hit by the enemy bullet. In this Code it take the spriterenderer of the
          playership which just shows the playership to the player and turns it on and off
          really quick for the invulnerablilty period that is set to indicate to the player
          that they took damage.During this invulnerablilty period the player cannot take
          more damage because in that time it is made so that the playership cannot collide
          with anything by changing the layer is being rendered on.
        </p>
        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p>Since this was something new to our group we kind of set a low expectation
          for ourselves, so it went well for the most part. What didnt go well was learning
          C# while at the same time learning how to use the Unity Engine was challenging for 
          everyone one of us, which meant it tooks us a while to get started which led us to 
          having a little less time than we wanted. Time management was also a major problem
          due to us preparing for our AP/Final exams which led to us having even less time. 
          This addition cost of time was shown in the game by out outdate looking UI & lack of
          content in the game.
        </p>
