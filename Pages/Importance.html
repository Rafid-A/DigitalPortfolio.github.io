        <h1>The importance of Digital Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Digital Portfolio is important to me because I think this is
          a simple yet very creative way to show off ones achievements
          and it allows me to show my achievements the way I want to show 
          them and possibly attract future employers to hire me.  Digital 
          Portfolios are important in general because they hold all your 
          accomplishments, achievements, and work which it allows you to 
          present it to the public so everyone can see how good you are. 
          It is that one place where everything you worked hard on will 
          be displayed and help you achieve the goal you were working 
          towards. It is a digital storage of ones hard work in a sense.
          Digital Portfolio for programmer/developers is very essential 
          and is a project in itself and is a very big asset to put on 
          the resume. It allows one to get more essential knowledge and 
          experience that they very well might need for their jobs in the 
          future. It also demonstrates personal improvement over a span of
	  time. A lot of people can feel stuck and this can help them reflect
	  on how far they have come and give them more movitivation.For other
	  jobs digital portfolio is still important because it gives them a
	  place to display their work for their employers to easily see and
	  encourage them to hire them.
