        <p>Hello! I am Rafid Ahmed. Currently I am a Senior in High School aspiring
          to be a software/web developer in the near future. In my years of high school the 
          computer science course has taught me a lot on how to become a better programmer. From 
          the CS-II course, I have learned all sorts of things such as Swift, Lindenmayer Systems, 
          Sorting Algorithms, Information about API, JSON, MVC and even how to make a game.
          Some of the other classes I took Were AP Calculus AB, AP World History, AP US History, AP Macroeconomics, AP Government,
          AC/DC Electrnoics & Computer Maintenence.
