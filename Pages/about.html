        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am Rafid Ahmed. I was born in Khulna, Bangladesh.I still vividly remember my life back in Bangladesh and it is something that will stick with for a while. I moved to the US around when I was 10 years old and started studying from
	  5th grade. I am very glad to have the oppurtunity of moving to US and learn to build a prosperous future for myself & my family. My current interests is in Computers in general, I really like them. So this interest had led me to the career
	  of Software Developer/Engineering and I have no plans on changing it. I am fully committed to my Career of choice.<br><br> Currently I am a Senior in High School aspiring to be a software/web developer in the near future. I am currently in
	  the CS3 course and have taken CS1 & CS2 course in the previous years of high school. In my years of high school the computer science course has taught me a lot on how to become a better programmer. From the CS-I course I have learned the
	  basics to get into programming and how to think like a problem solver and logically solve problems, which was a big takeaway point from that course. From the CS-II course, I have learned all sorts of things such as Swift, Lindenmayer Systems
	  , Sorting Algorithms, Information about API, JSON, MVC and even how to make a game. Some of the other classes that are most related to this fied are AP Calculus AB, AC/DC Electrnoics & Computer Maintenence. Other things I have worked on in
	the past is making a Unity game with my classmates as a group project, so I have a little experience there. I have also worked on a Scheduling website with my classmates for Arena Scheduling for our school, which gave me the experience of
	working with an API, JSON, and JavaScript.</p>
