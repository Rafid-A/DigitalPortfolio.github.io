      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the modern world, we are very dependent on technology. We use everything from Computers to Phones to even Smart Home Technologies to just turn on/off a lightbulb. A big part of these
	technologies are the Internet which is a mesh of networks that connects these devices together. There are a lot of things that happen on the internet within milliseconds while we are browsing through it, some
	of these are for our security, others are there for the internet to work at all in the first place.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most websites' naming scheme starts with a HTTP or HTTPS(Hypertext Transfer Protocol
	Secure) at the beginning of its URL(Uniform Resource Locator). The s at the end of HTTP means the website is secure. The main purpose of this protocol is that it secures communication and data transfer between
	the web browser and a website. It also helps against attacks that are meant to steal the users or organizations data. Due to this method private institutions can see less of what their employees/students are
	doing on the internet which they don't like. So they responded by deploying a new technology called HTTPS Proxy Appliances. It is placed between the user and the internet and serves as a point of control over
	employee/student internet use.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Security issues such as MITM(Man In the Middle) which is where the attacker eavesdropped on the conversation between two targets such as the user and the web
	application. The risks to this is that they can harvest personal information or login credentials and even possibly install malware on computers/phones. Hashing is simply passing data through a formula that
	produces a result, it usually is a string of characters and they are usually the same length regardless of the amount of data it has. An example of this would be MD5 hash which always produces 32 character long
	hashes. Some essential qualities that make a has a good hash are that the has value is fully determined by the data being hashed, the has function uses all the input data, and the function uniformly distributes
	the data across the entire hash value. CA(Certificate Authority is an entity that stores,signs and issues digital certificates. Their role is to verify websites so the user knows who they are communicating with
	and vice versa, and to make the internet a more secure place.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificates like an SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) certificate, which establishes an encrypted link between a server and a client are
	used by the CA. While SSL interception cannot be prevented it can be detected because it is not possible to completely spoof any security certificate. Website SSL Security certificates prove the site’s PUblic
	cryptographic key which is the public side of the server’s secret Private cryptographic key which is never publicly disclosed. Only the public key can be used to encrypt data which the server can decrypt using
	its matching private key. Since the SSL Proxy does not have the private key, they are forced to use a different public key that has a matching private key with the server which means if there is a SSL
	interception the public key must be different than normal.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Smaller websites usually use one security certificate on their web servers while bigger websites such as Amazon or Google use
	multiple. But that means that not every user of the bigger websites would obtain the same security certificate which leads to false positives that their connections were being intercepted when they simply just
	received a different certificate. On the other hand False negatives are uncaught cyber threats or interception of the traffic which are present, this could happen because they are highly sophisticated, dormant
	or the security infrastructure is lacking. Now as to if an organization should be allowed to eavesdrop is a very subjective question. In my opinion, yes they should have a right to eavesdrop and it's
	understandable why, but it needs to be limited to an extent, to what extent I don’t know but heavily enough that it shouldn’t make people constantly fear for their privacy.
