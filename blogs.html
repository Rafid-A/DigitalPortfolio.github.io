    <h1>3-May-2023 Topic: BYOD Policy</h1>
    <p>This policy change is very stupid. I do not understand why AllenISD thought that us not being able to use our own devices, but rather use their devices is better. Like how dumb do you have to be to no understand that students like to use their own device for multile reasons be it privacy or something else. I personally have been using the BYOD network all the time in school because it is a more secure network than the GUEST network and usually is faster. I can't even form words right now because of how stupid this decision is. Them forcing us to use their devices is just so so unfathomably stupid, its insane. I need to have a personal talk with the AllenISD educational board of directors and ask them exactly what do they see that makes then take this decision. It is much better to leave the students with their own device but also allow them to use school devices on the other netwroks. It is better to have more choices and not less.</p><br>
    <h1>5-May-2023 Topic: AI Regulation </h1>
    <p>I am against Government putting regulations on AI. The reason why I say this is because I feel like the regulations that are set by the companies are already quite strict enough in my opinion. Government coming into this would only mean that the regulation on AI would become more strict which would really hinder the progress on AI as it learns from data and putting more regulation on it means it will haveless data in the end to learn from. Also there should not be a need to put a regulaiton on AI from the Government in the first place as AI has not advanced to the point where we need a legislative bod to come in and put laws and rules around something that is not even developed. The only things AI can do for the public at the momemnt that are significant is make their lives easier, not harded so I dont see the reasoning. However, I can maybe see some reasoning in why people would support this, but I think AI still needs to develop for a few more years atleast to answer where a regulation by government is needed or not.</p><br>
